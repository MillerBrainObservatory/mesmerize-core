Lazy Arrays for CNMF
********************

Lazy Arrays for CNMF make it possible to view very large arrays for the reconstructed movie (RCM),
reconstructed background (RCB) and residuals which would otherwise be larger than RAM. You can construct them yourself
or get them from respective cnmf extensions: ``get_rcm()``, ``get_rcb()``, and ``get_residuals()``.
